"""CI fence for the Claude Code plugin-marketplace distribution.

The repo doubles as its own plugin marketplace: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
is the catalog, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` the plugin manifest, and
`hooks/hooks.json` the plugin hook wiring. These tests keep the three manifests
parseable, mutually consistent, version-synced with pyproject.toml, and honest
about the files they reference - so `/plugin install` never ships a broken tree.

Verified against a live local install (marketplace add + install + `claude mcp
list` shows the bundled server Connected) before this fence was written.
