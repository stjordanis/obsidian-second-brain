## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/notebooklm` command (research toolkit):** the source-grounded parallel to `/research-deep`. Same vault-first scan logic, but instead of routing gap-fill queries to Perplexity + Grok over the open web, it uploads the top 12 vault notes to a Gemini File Search store and asks Gemini (default `gemini-2.5-pro`) for a synthesis grounded against those sources. Single-phase: `--topic "..."` runs the whole flow end-to-end and writes an AI-first synthesis to `Research/NotebookLM/YYYY-MM-DD - <slug>.md` plus a propagation payload for `/obsidian-save`. No browser step, no manual paste. Same one-HTTP-call shape as `/research-deep`. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey (free tier available). Cost: roughly $0.01 to $0.05 per run ($0.15/M tokens indexed, storage free). Optional `NOTEBOOKLM_MODEL` env override. Listed under `research` category; total command count is now 33 (was 32). The two research tracks (open-web via `/research-deep`, vault-grounded via `/notebooklm`) are designed to run in parallel for high-value topics. Contradictions across the two tracks are where the insight is.
- **`bootstrap_vault.py --preset` and `--mode` flags:** wires the preset/mode interface that `SKILL.md` documented but the script never implemented (running `--preset researcher` errored with `unrecognized arguments: --preset researcher --mode personal`). Five presets land at once, matching the existing SKILL.md description verbatim: `default` (preserves existing Life-OS layout — no change in behavior when no flag is passed), `executive` (Decisions/People/Meetings/OKRs · Boards: OKRs/Quarterly/Weekly), `builder` (Projects/Dev Logs/Architecture/Debugging · Boards: Backlog/Sprint/In Progress/Done), `creator` (Content/Ideas/Audience/Publishing · Boards: Ideas/Drafts/Scheduled/Published), `researcher` (Sources/Literature/Hypotheses/Methodology/Synthesis · Boards: Reading/Processing/Synthesized/Done). Each preset declares its folder list, kanban columns, `_CLAUDE.md` folder map, Home dashboard nav, and template extras via a single `PRESETS` dict at the top of the file — adding a new preset is one dict entry plus optional template lines in `write_preset_extras()`. Two modes: `personal` (default — owner-style `_CLAUDE.md`) and `assistant` (uses the `references/claude-md-assistant-template.md` schema, requires `--subject "Name"` and renders the operator/subject distinction). Fully backwards-compatible: `--path`, `--name`, `--jobs`, `--no-sidebiz` keep their meaning under the default preset; `--no-sidebiz` is silently ignored on non-default presets. The vault-not-empty check now ignores `.obsidian/` so re-running on a vault that only has Obsidian config no longer prompts.
- **`/create-command` interview flow (Phase 5):** new meta command that scaffolds a new `commands/<name>.md` through a 9-phase conversation — zero markdown editing. Asks intent, name, category, triggers, behavior steps, AI-first compliance, and external API needs, then writes a fully-formed command file (frontmatter + body + AI-first footer where applicable) using the Write tool. The new file flows automatically into every platform via the existing adapters — no extra build steps. Lowers the contribution bar so anyone can extend the skill, and every command added through this flow lands AI-first-compliant by construction. Listed under `meta` category; total command count is now 32 (was 31).
- **Write-time AI-first validator (Phase 4):** new `hooks/validate-ai-first.sh` runs as a Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook after every `Write` or `Edit` on a markdown file inside `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`. Warns (non-blocking) when the file fails the AI-first rule: missing frontmatter delimiters, missing required fields (`date`, `type`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`), tabs in YAML, or missing `## For future Claude` preamble. Surfaces specific warnings on stderr so Claude can repair the note in the same turn. Skips `raw/`, `templates/`, `_export/`, `.obsidian/`, `.git/`, `.trash/` and anything outside the vault. Platform-neutral spec at `hooks/validate-ai-first.hook.yaml`. Setup instructions in `SKILL.md` under "Write-Time AI-First Validator (PostToolUse Hook)". This is the **write-time cleanup primitive** that the Second Brain for Companies thesis depends on — humans write inconsistent input, the validator enforces AI-first discipline automatically.
- **Multilingual trigger phrases (Phase 3):** every command now declares `triggers_<lang>:` lines in its frontmatter. English (`triggers_en:`) is populated for all 31 commands; the schema is extensible to any language via `triggers_es:`, `triggers_it:`, `triggers_fr:`, `triggers_de:`, `triggers_pt:`, `triggers_ru:`, `triggers_ja:` (community contributions welcome). The non-Claude dispatchers (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) now include a `## Trigger phrases` section grouped by language then by category, so AI agents on those platforms can match natural-language requests without seeing the slash form. Adapters auto-detect which languages are populated; empty languages do not appear in the output. Documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` under "Translating trigger phrases (multilingual support)".
- **Command categorization (Phase 2):** each command in `commands/` now declares a `category:` (vault, thinking, research, meta). Non-Claude dispatcher tables in `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` are now emitted as four grouped sections instead of one 31-row blob. Adapters use the shared `emit_routing_table_grouped` helper in `adapters/lib.sh`, so the categorization carries through automatically when a new command is added. No breaking changes — Claude Code build is still a byte-exact identity copy.
- **Multi-platform adapter pattern (Phase 1):** one source, four platforms.
  - `scripts/build.sh` orchestrator + `scripts/lib.sh` utility helpers
  - `adapters/lib.sh` shared parsing, path rewriting, tool-name neutralization
  - `adapters/claude-code/adapter.sh` — identity copy (Claude Code is the canonical platform)
  - `adapters/codex-cli/adapter.sh` — emits `AGENTS.md` + `.codex/commands/`
  - `adapters/gemini-cli/adapter.sh` — emits `GEMINI.md` + `.gemini/commands/`
  - `adapters/opencode/adapter.sh` — emits `AGENTS.md` + `.opencode/commands/`
  - Auto-generated routing tables (parses each command's `description:` frontmatter)
  - Tool-name neutralization for non-Claude platforms (`Read tool` → `read files`, etc.)
  - Per-platform `exclude:` frontmatter field for opt-outs
  - Build output goes to `dist/<platform>/` (gitignored)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with full contributor guide
- `CLAUDE.md` at repo root for contributor-facing operating instructions
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- `.github/` community files: issue templates, PR template, FUNDING.yml
- `CITATION.cff` for Google Scholar / Zenodo / OpenSSF
- `llms.txt` at repo root for AI crawlers (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
- FAQ section in README to boost AI-search citation rate
- GitHub Pages site with Cayman theme + jekyll-seo-tag + jekyll-sitemap
- Banner image and polished author hero in README
- `examples/sample-vault/` showing 6 AI-first compliant note types (daily, person, project, idea, devlog, plus `_CLAUDE.md` template)
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting policy and coordinated disclosure timeline
- Schema.org JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` block on the Pages site (`_includes/head_custom.html`) for rich-result eligibility and AI-search citation
- 3 new FAQ entries targeting "Obsidian plugin vs Claude Code skill" search intent

### Changed

- GitHub About description rewritten to lead with "Claude Code skill for Obsidian"
- README banner alt text now contains the full search-intent phrasing
- GitHub topics: swapped `markdown` and `pkm` for `obsidian-skill` and `claude-code-skill`

### Fixed

- **`bootstrap_vault.py` `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows `cp1252` consoles.** The script's emoji print statements (`🧠 Bootstrapping vault: ...`, `📁 Folders created`, `✅ Vault bootstrapped at: ...`) crashed on Windows before doing any work because the default Python `sys.stdout` encoding on Windows PowerShell / cmd is `cp1252`, which has no codepoints for those characters. `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are now reconfigured to UTF-8 at script start, wrapped in `try/except (AttributeError, ValueError)` so non-text streams or environments without `.reconfigure()` fall back gracefully.
- **Removed dead `--minimal` flag from `bootstrap_vault.py`.** `argparse` accepted `--minimal` but the value was never passed into `bootstrap()` — the flag had no effect for any user since v0.1.0. Removing it changes no behavior.
- `pyproject.toml` version was `0.1.0`, now matches the v0.6.0 release tag.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- `references/ai-first-rules.md` — canonical spec for vault writes (the 7 rules, frontmatter schemas per note type, preamble templates, anti-patterns, audit checklist).

### Changed

- All 31 commands now explicitly reference the AI-first rule. Surgical cross-reference per command file, no body rewrites. Closes the gap where two Claude sessions on the same conversation could produce inconsistently structured notes.
- `references/write-rules.md` now points to `ai-first-rules.md` as the foundation.
- `SKILL.md` — new "AI-first vault rule" section under Core Operating Principles.

### Notes

- 29 files changed, +406 lines, 0 breaking changes. Additive only.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Research Toolkit** — five new commands that turn the vault into a live research workspace.
  - `/x-read [url]` — verbatim X post + thread + TL;DR + key claims + reply sentiment (Grok-4 + x_search).
  - `/x-pulse [topic]` — what's hot on X, gaps, working hooks, post ideas (Grok-4.20-reasoning + x_search).
  - `/research [topic]` — web research dossier with citations, recency markers, contrarian views, open questions (Perplexity Sonar Pro).
  - `/research-deep [topic]` — vault-first: scans vault, identifies gaps, fills only those, synthesizes a delta report, propagates updates via `/obsidian-save` (Perplexity sonar-reasoning-pro + Grok + vault scan).
  - `/youtube [url]` — transcript + metadata + top comments, summarized AI-first (youtube-transcript-api + YouTube Data API v3 + Grok-4).
- Section 0 of `_CLAUDE.md` template — first version of the AI-first vault rule, applied to all 5 research commands from day one.
- API key handling at `~/.config/obsidian-second-brain/.env` (Mac-local, never synced).
- `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` for Python dependency management.
- Auto-open behavior: every research save pops Obsidian to the new note via `obsidian://open?...`.

### Notes

- Command count went 26 → 31. Same install, same `_CLAUDE.md`.
- Without API keys, the original 26 commands still work — research toolkit degrades gracefully.
